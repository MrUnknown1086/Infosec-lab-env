This is an Idea which came in my mind this morning (1st november 2025). 
While reading about google dorking in OWASP guide I thought why not create such a tool which works for the user for google dorking.

Hers the working model IDEA:
> Our model fetches all the url based search dork from google dorks and keep in its system and updates them on a regular bases.
> Then after getting the user intended url, it appends the target url to the google dorks and searches at the backend, there it collects the results headings, a bit intro and its status code.
> As I learned from OWASP that all the search engines search results are different, so it will combine the resukts from all the search engines and filter out DUPLICATE ones and display the result to the user.
> The crucial ones will be displayed in RED color, will match the keyword from the url. EX: api-> RED, Notice-> Green. means a keyword-based Severity Analysis


#FOllow up ideas by AI:


1. Integrate Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Yandex, Brave (all have different indexing behavior).
   Implement result ranking fusion and deduplication logic.
   Optionally, let users toggle specific engines to use.


2. Integrate with other recon tools via API or modular scripts:
   subfinder, amass, waybackurls, gau, httpx, etc.
   Example: After discovering URLs → run HTTPx or Nuclei templates for quick vuln detection.


3. “Leak Intelligence” Module (Legal OSINT Only)

You can expand to fetch information from:
Public paste sites (e.g., Pastebin, Ghostbin)
GitHub code search (via API)
Public datasets (like public S3 buckets, common crawl)
DOnt just limit yourself to these specific assets to search from, expand your ground and go more deep


4. Smart Filtering / NLP Matching

Use fuzzy search or simple NLP to detect similar results even if URLs differ slightly (e.g. /api/v1/login and /api/v2/login).
Rank results by potential sensitivity.


5. Performance & Caching

Cache results to avoid repeated engine queries.
Use async requests for faster aggregation.
Respect rate limits and introduce random delays to simulate human-like searching.



##This is where our poject stand out:
Where your idea adds clear differentiation
Cross-engine fusion + deduplication — many tools target one engine; merging results intelligently across engines (and deduping) is less common. 

Severity-coloring based on URL/keyword context — automated risk scoring and visual prioritization (red/green) would speed triage.

Enrichment (status code, server header, response size, screenshot) — some tools already pull status codes, but a uniform enriched view + thumbnails is nicer.

Scheduled scans + historical diffs — tracking what appeared/disappeared is a strong recon feature not always built-in.

LLM-assisted analysis — automatically summarize/sniff likely sensitive findings or false positives, which some hobbyists are starting to do but is not ubiquitous.

Quick recommendations to make it stand out (practical next steps)

Build a modular search engine layer so you can add/remove engines (Google via SERP APIs or scraping, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, GitHub code search). (Many tools scrape single engines today.) 
GitHub

Add result enrichment (HEAD requests for status & headers, optional screenshot via headless browser).

Implement smart dedupe (normalize hosts/paths, fuzzy matching for similar endpoints) and category filters (admin panels, config, credentials).

Make the dork DB auto-updating (pull curated lists from GitHub + let users contribute).

Offer exportable, shareable reports and an API so other tools (httpx, nuclei) can consume findings for automated validation.
